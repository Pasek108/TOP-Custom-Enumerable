# The Odin Project :thinking:

## What is it  
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) is a free, open-source curriculum that teaches web development from the ground up. It covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Git, React, and back-end technologies like Node.js and Ruby on Rails, offering a structured path from beginner to job-ready developer. The curriculum includes hands-on projects, coding exercises, and real-world applications to reinforce learning.

## Is it worth doing  
The Odin Project is an excellent resource for self-taught developers looking for a structured and comprehensive learning path. It encourages active learning through projects and collaboration with the community. However, since it requires self-discipline and problem-solving skills, those who prefer guided instruction with direct mentorship might find it challenging.

## About

This repository complements the [Custom Enumerables Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-custom-enumerables) in the Ruby Course for The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. This project will also familiarize you with how to work with blocks and procs. Some starter code and specs are provided to validate the correctness of your solutions.
